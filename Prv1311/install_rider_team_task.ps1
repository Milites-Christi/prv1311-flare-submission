Registers rider_team.py as a Windows Scheduled Task -- same shape as
install_footprint_worker_task.ps1:
  - starts automatically at boot, before any user logs in (Trigger: AtStartup)
  - runs as SYSTEM (LogonType ServiceAccount -- no stored password, no login required)
  - restarts automatically if the process ever exits (RestartCount/RestartInterval)

rider_team.py is ledger-only -- open_rider()/close_rider() do pure in-memory
arithmetic against data/rider_ledger.json (+ a Supabase mirror). No exchange
order calls anywhere in the file. Confirmed before writing this script.
That's why this uses the same RestartCount 999 as the worker, unmodified --
there's no live-order risk to guard against with a different restart policy.

MUST be run from an elevated ("Run as Administrator") PowerShell:

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\Autry\accum-flip\Prv1311\install_rider_team_task.ps1"

Idempotent: safe to re-run. Unregisters any existing task with the same name first.
